> Description

```shell
Narak is the Hindu equivalent of Hell. You are in the pit with the Lord of Hell himself. Can you use your hacking skills to get out of the Narak? Burning walls and demons are around every corner even your trusty tools will betray you on this quest. Trust no one. Just remember the ultimate mantra to escape Narak “Enumeration”. After getting the root you will indeed agree “Hell ain’t a bad place to be”.

Objective: Find 2 flags (user.txt and root.txt)
```
